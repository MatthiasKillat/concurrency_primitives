# concurrency_primitives
prototype implementation of some concurrency primitives

One goal is to potentially identify faster or more portable alternatives of frequently needed building blocks in concurrent programming.

Another goal is to implement useful higher level abstractions in terms of lower level primitives (i.e. futex, semaphore)
